## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[W3Schools]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I have learned a little HTML and CSS before, so that part is not hard. But JavaScript does take me something to understand. The most difficult part for me is not the coding but the gif image. I didn't know I follow the video but the image didn't show. I tried many times redo it.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Will a web development has been able to decide the layout of the web? Or it all depends on the designer? Can HTML, CSS work with Java to build a website? Because I learned Java most of the time, so I want to know how it works.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would like to spend on the CSS part and add some functions, add a more complicated version.]
